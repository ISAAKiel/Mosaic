# Mosaic
Summer School 2016 at Kiel University

Aim
---
This Summer School focuses on interaction
as a key concept in social life, and on
methods for reconstructing and modeling
spheres of interaction at different spatial and
temporal scales. Students will learn an
innovative approach, used in recent studies,
for modelling spheres of interaction. The
course will cover a variety of theories and
concepts that will enable students to apply
this method to further regions, material
groups, and time periods. The course is
divided into individual lessons presented by
experts, thus providing a diverse overview of 
approaches.

About Mosaic
---
At Kiel University there is a growing
interdisciplinary community which strives to
establish an integrative concept and culture
of modelling. The intention behind Mosaic is
to convey the Kiel spirit of interdisciplinary
modelling and to facilitate knowledge
transfer on basic theories, methods and
techniques in spatio-temporal modelling. In
this summer school we will introduce
participants to the basics of modelling, mathematics,
trends, boundaries, movement,
interaction and networks.
